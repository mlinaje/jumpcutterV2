# jumpcutterV2
Automatically edits videos, inspired by carykh

Carykh's approach was limiting:
1. The program extracted EVERY frame and put it into a single, This requires GBs, maybe even TBs of your storage space.
2. The program would fail if the video was more than 2 hours long.
3. While the program was working on the audio, it kept making small audio files that made it very slow

This project exists to solve all of those problems.

# Differences
This program is 5x faster than the original

# Usage
`python3 jumpcutter.py video.mp4`

# heads up
It only works with mp4 files, support for other formats may come later.

This project uses python3, please use the latest version.
